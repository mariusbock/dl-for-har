        "\n",
        "This notebook will teach you everything you need to know about validation and testing. When building a predictive pipeline there are a lot of parameters which one needs to set before comencing the actual training. Coming up with a suitable set of hyperparameters is called hypertuning. In order to gain feedback whether the applied hyperparameters are a good choice, we check the predictive performance of our model on the validation set. This is called validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you might ask yourself: Solely relying and tuning based on the validation scores would inherit that your trained model would end up being too well optimized on the validation set and thus not general anymore, right? If asked yourself that question, then you are 100% right in your assumption! This is what we call overfitting and is one of the major pitfalls in Machine Learning.Overfitting your model results in bad prediction performance on unseen data. \n",
        "\n",
        "We therefore need a third dataset, called the test dataset. The test dataset is a part of the initial dataset which you keep separate from all optimization steps. It is only used to gain insights on the predictive performance of the model and must not (!) be used as a reference for tuning hyperparameters. As we mentioned in during the theoretical parts of this tutorial, (supervised) Deep Learning, in our opinion, is just a fancy word for function approximation. If your model performs both well during validation and testing, it is a general function which properly approximates the underlying function.\n",

For example, you could use 60% of your data for training, 20% for validation and 20% for testing. The three splits can also be chosen to be stratified, meaning that the relative label distribution within each of the two dataset is kept the same as in the full dataset. Note that stratifiying your data would require the data to be shuffled.\n",

        "The k-fold cross-validation is the most popular form of cross-validation. Instead of only splitting our data once into a train and validation dataset, like we did in the previous validation method, we take the average of k different train-valid splits. To do so we take our concatenated version of the train and validation set and split it into k equal-sized chunks of data. A so-called fold is now that we train our network using all but one of these chunks of data and validate it using the chunk we excluded (thus being unseen data). The process is repeated k-times, i.e. k-folds, so that each chunk of data is the validation dataset exactly once. Note that with each fold, the network needs to be reinitialized, i.e. trained from scratch, to ensure that it is not predicting already seen data.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Note:** It is recommended to use stratified k-fold cross-validation, i.e. each of the k chunks of data has the same distribution of labels as the original full dataset. This avoids the risk, especially for unbalanced datasets, of having certain labels missing within the train dataset, which would cause the validation process to break. Nevertheless, as also stated above, stratification requires shuffeling and thus one should always first apply the sliding window before applying the split.\n",
