    "During this tutorial we will use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as our Deep Learning framework of choice. The open source library is one of the most popular frameworks out there for applying Deep Learning. It has all the necessary building blocks found in neural networks pre-implemented as well as offers a variety of helpful functions which can be used to easily implement your first Deep Learning script with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will define our neural network architecture. Once defined we can use our previously preprocessed sensor-data to train a network which will be able to predict the type of activities being performed for a given sliding window. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned during the introduction to this chapter, the architecture which we will used is called **DeepConvLSTM** [[1]](#1). The architecture was introduced by Francisco Javier Ordonez and Daniel Roggen in 2016 and is to this date a state-of-the-art architecture for applying Deep Learning on Human Activity Recognition. The architecture combines both convolutional and recurrent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is made of three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional layers:** Convolutional layers are based on filters (e.g. a 2 by 1 matrix) shifting over some input (e.g. a sliding window) resulting in activation feature map. The main idea of convolutions is that they are able to detect a specific type of feature anywhere within the input. Within the original architecture Ordonez and Roggen apply 4 convolutional layers each with 64 filters of size 5 by 1. \n",
    "2. **LSTM layer(s):** After applying convolutional layers, Ordonez and Roggen make us of an LSTM in order to capture time dependencies on features extracted by convolutional operations. An LSTM is a type of neural network which is able to learn temporal dependencies in data via gated mechanisms. The LSTM itself is structured into layers. Within the original architecture Ordonez and Roggen employ a 2-layered LSTM with 128 hidden units. \n",
    "3. **Classification layer:** The output of the LSTM is finally fed into a classifier which is a fully-connected layer and produces the final predictions. Preceeding the classifier, Ordonez and Roggen additionally put a dropout layer, which is a form of regularization. A dropout layer randomly deactivates neurons according to a dropout probability and thus prevents the probability of your network overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contradicting to popular belief that one needs at least a 2-layered LSTM when dealing with sequential data, within a recent work of ours, we exhibited that a 1-layered LSTM might be a better suited option when dealing with raw sensor-data [[2]](#2). Therefore, within the next code block, we will define the altered DeepConvLSTM architecture as presented in our paper which **employs a 1-layered instead of 2-layered LSTM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to give you a better idea of how to define your PyTorch implementation of the DeepConvLSTM, we already defined a [PyTorch module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) called **DeepConvLSTM** for you to start out with. A PyTorch module typically consists of two main functions - the `init()` and `forward()` function. Within the former all relevant parameters and building blocks of the neural network are defined. Within the latter the parameters and building blocks are put together, i.e. the computation of the network defined. Within the next tasks you will be asked to fill in some of the missing parts of said module function."

    "Great, we now have a neural network defined which we can call and use for training! But, there is one essential step missing before moving on towards the training loop - your data needs to be put into the correct format (again). In addition to the preprocessing steps that you know from the previous notebook, we also need to **make sure that our dataset is using the correct data types which are compatible with a GPU**. Furthermore, our data needs to be split into a **training** and **validation** dataset. As you know from the [theoretical part of this section](https://mariusbock.github.io/dl-for-har), within Deep Learning we essentially try to approximate a function. To judge whether the parameterized function we came up with appropriately approximates such underlying function, we validate our network's perfomance on unseen data. If the algorithm still performs well, i.e. predicts the correct labels for the unseen data, we say that we have found a **generalized function**. The next notebook will cover in more detail what different validation methods exist and go into detail why we need and what common pitfalls exist.\n",

    "2. Apply the sliding window approach on top of the training and validation dataset. As you learned in the previous notebook, we do not classify a single record, but a window of records. The label of the last record within a window defines the label of the window and is our ultimate goal to predict.\n",

Pass the `DataLoader` object the dataset variables, the `batch_size` you want to use and set `shuffle=True`. (`lines 48-54`)\n",
    "4. Further define the training loop by iterating over the training `DataLoader` object. We already defined parts for you. In a nutshell: for each batch, compute the loss by passing it through the network; backprogate the computed loss using your optimizer object. Use the [.backward()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) of the loss object and [.step()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) of the optimizer to do so. (`lines 74-75 and 80-83`)\n",
    "5. While training obtain predictions for the train dataset. To do so obtain the final predicitons for each batch by applying the PyTorch `softmax` [function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.softmax.html) on top of the network output. (`lines 85-86`)\n",
    "6. After training obtain predictions for the validation dataset using the resulting trained network of the current epoch. Iterate again over the validation `DataLoader` object and fed each batch through the network. In addition to calculating the [cross-entropy loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html), obtain the final predicitons for each batch by applying the PyTorch `softmax` [function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.softmax.html) on top of the network output. Using the predictions the script will calculate [accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html), [precision](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html), [recall](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html) and [F1-score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html) on both your training and validation set. (`lines 118-119 and 124-125`)\n",
    "7. Play around with different values for the parameters within the `config` file. How does each one of them influence your training loop? Feel free to also use a completly different optimizer - you can find all the different options on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html). (`lines 12-27`)"
