        "We finally introduce a more complex analysis of the dataset. As the next notebook will show you, we need to segment our data using a sliding window approach. The size of the windows is often a crucial parameter, which you need to decide upon before training your network. Sometimes, smaller windows are required due to activities changing fast -- smaller windows will also give you essentially more data to train, as you are chunking the data into smaller pieces. On the other hand, small windows can also lead to your network not recognizing characteristical traits within the data and thus hurt the expressiveness of your data. [Muharari and Ploetz](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3267242.3267287) phrase it best: \"Decisions regarding any sliding window procedure are hard and often final decisions that impact the recognition procedure as a whole. As such mistakes made here are critical and errors made are difficult to recover from.\" [[5]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mariusbock/dl-for-har/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/intro_and_data_analysis.ipynb?hl=en#scrollTo=t0akNjYypv_y)\n",

For each subject as well as overall the function `analyze_window_lengths` gives you:\n",
