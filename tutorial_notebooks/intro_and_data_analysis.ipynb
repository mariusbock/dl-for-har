        "Now let us focus on visualizing acceleration data in the next task. Even though raw accelerometer readings are less intelligible than, for instance, images, we can still visualize the accelerometer timeseries along the x axis. Within the next coding task, you will use a function `plot_activity`, which will plot data belonging to sample activities as a simple timeseries plot. Accelerometer data measures both acceleration in three-dimensional space and orientation, leading often to problems in classification when the sensor is worn in different orientations or body placements between datasets [[6, 7]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mariusbock/dl-for-har/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/intro_and_data_analysis.ipynb?hl=en#scrollTo=t0akNjYypv_y). Interesting parameters for accelerometers are their sampling rate (in Herz, for instance 100Hz), their range (in g, for instance -8g to 8g).

        "We finally introduce a more complex analysis of the dataset. As the next notebook will show you, we need to segment our data using a sliding window approach. The size of the windows is often a crucial parameter, which you need to decide upon before training your network. Sometimes, smaller windows are required due to activities changing fast -- smaller windows will also give you essentially more data to train, as you are chunking the data into smaller pieces. On the other hand, small windows can also lead to your network not recognizing characteristical traits within the data and thus hurt the expressiveness of your data. [Muharari and Ploetz](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3267242.3267287) phrase it best: \"Decisions regarding any sliding window procedure are hard and often final decisions that impact the recognition procedure as a whole. As such mistakes made here are critical and errors made are difficult to recover from.\" [[5]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mariusbock/dl-for-har/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/intro_and_data_analysis.ipynb?hl=en#scrollTo=t0akNjYypv_y)\n",
        "\n",
        "We therefore implemented [helpful functions](https://github.com/mariusbock/dl-for-har/blob/main/data_processing/data_analysis.py) within our GitHub, which allows you to get a summary of the activities in your dataset. For each subject as well as overall the function `analyze_window_lengths` gives you:\n",
        "1. A list of all the activities that are included and how long they lasted\n",
        "2. The average, maximum and minimum time each activity lasted\n",
        "\n",
        "This can help you better understand your use case at hand, and decide on how large or small your sliding windows should be."
